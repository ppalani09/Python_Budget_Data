# Python_Budget_Data
Data Science Bootcamp - HW #3 - Python HW

I've created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company given input financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The script produces the following outputs:

    The total number of months included in the dataset


    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


    The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


    The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
